The areas that I concentrated on during this project were the validation along with the security of the given form.
The version provided had employed an unsupported method of deleting data, but I substituted it with POST to secure it.
I also inserted explicit types of input, type=email and<|human|>I also inserted explicit input type,type=email and
type=number,to be applied by browsers automatically.

To enhance the integrity of data I added such attributes as required, minlength, maxlength, min, and max. 
These assist in avoiding the invalid or unnecessarily lengthy inputs that may create the issue of the database.

The most security improvement was the one changing the hidden password field to the visible password input.
using type="password". This will avoid accidentally revealing data and enhance trust.
Also, it was equipped with autocomplete properties to improve the user experience and act as a security measure.

If it was live production, I would then go ahead and secure it with HTTPS, server-side, further.
sanitizing all the incoming data and making sure that every piece of information is validated and stored in a database.

I, Hillal Merabtene, affirm that all work submitted in this case study is my own. 
I have not used AI tools, AI-generated text, or AI-based writing assistants (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Grammarly AI, etc.) in the creation of this assignment. 
I understand that using AI tools for this project violates the spirit of ethical learning and may result in academic consequences.
